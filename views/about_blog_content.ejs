                     <br/>
                    <p>My name is Jae Oh. I am currently located in Queens, New York where diversity is the #1 in the world!</p>

                    <p> I am a web developer who likes to talk about foods in general. </p>

                    <p> I started this personal blog as to share my food experiences and my ongoing adventures!</p>  

                    <p> Honestly, I can't talk or review foods like Yelp, Michellin Guide, ZAGAT,EATERS or Munchies and I am not willing to replicate any of them.</p>

                    <p>Instead! You'll experience SLACKING talks from me! That includes a talk between SERIOUS and EASY GOING. </p>
